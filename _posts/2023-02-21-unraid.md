## Installation

* download the [USB creator](https://unraid.net/download) from the unraid website
* create a bootable USB stick with the USB creator (<= 2GB)
* enable Advanced/CPU config/SVM or VMX (virtualization) in the BIOS
* enable IOMMU in the BIOS
* boot from the USB stick (you may need to change the boot order in the BIOS and disable secure boot)
* (optional) run Memtest86+ to check for memory errors
* boot into unraid

## Getting started

* access the web interface at `http://<ip-address>:80`
* set root password
* buy a license or use the trial
* check if all disks are detected in the `main` tab

### Array setup

* select your parity drive(s) in the `main` tab (use the biggest drives)
* select the drive(s) for the cache pool (use the fastest drives)
* put the rest of the drives in the `Disk` pool and press `start array`
* now all drives have to be formatted and the array has to be built

### Basic setup

* setup shares (at least on appdata cache only share for docker containers)
* (optional) setup share for time machine backups
* setup a second user to access shares from other devices
* go to `Apps` and install the `Community Applications` plugin
* install gpu drivers (if you have a gpu / nvidia recommended)

```

#### Scripts

* [Dump_GPU_vBIOS](https://github.com/SpaceinvaderOne) (no shedule)
