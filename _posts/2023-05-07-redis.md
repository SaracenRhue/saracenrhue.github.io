## What is Redis?

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams.

Since it's in-memory, it's very fast. It's also persistent, but the data is gone when the server is restarted.

## Python bindings

### install

```bash
pip3 install redis
```

### Usage

Connect to a redis server

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='192.168.178.132', port=6379, decode_responses=True)
```

### Strings

get and set a value

```python
r.set('key', 'value')
```

```python
r.get('key')
```

### Lists

get and set a list

```python
r.lpush('list', 'value')
```

```python
r.lrange('list', 0, -1)
```

### Dicts

get and set a dict

```python
r.hset('user123', mapping={
    'name': 'John',
    'surname': 'Smith',

    'age': 29
})
```
