## Basic Usage
- **Piping Between Commands**: 
  ```bash
  command1 | command2
  ```
  Output of `command1` is used as input for `command2`.

## Combining Multiple Commands
- **Sequential Commands**: 
  ```bash
  command1 | command2 | command3
  ```
  Output of `command1` is passed to `command2`, and its output is passed to `command3`.

## Filtering and Processing Text
- **Grep**: 
  ```bash
  command | grep 'pattern'
  ```
  Filters the output of `command` for lines containing 'pattern'.

- **Sort**: 
  ```bash
  command | sort
  ```
  Sorts the output of `command`.

- **Awk**: 
  ```bash
  command | awk '{print $1}'
  ```
  Processes the output of `command` using `awk` (e.g., prints the first column).

- **Sed**: 
  ```bash
  command | sed 's/old/new/'
  ```
  Processes the output of `command` using `sed` (e.g., replaces 'old' with 'new').

## Redirection and File Operations
- **Tee**: 
  ```bash
  command | tee file.txt
  ```
  The output of `command` is both displayed and written to `file.txt`.

## Combining Text Streams
- **Paste**: 
  ```bash
  command1 | paste - command2
  ```
  Combines the output of `command1` and `command2` side by side.

## Networking and Data Transfer
- **Curl and Processing**: 
  ```bash
  curl -s http://example.com | grep 'title'
  ```
  Fetches data from a URL and filters it.

- **SSH and Remote Commands**: 
  ```bash
  ssh user@host 'cat file' | grep 'pattern'
  ```
  Executes a command on a remote machine and processes the output locally.

## Advanced Usage
- **Process Substitution**: 
  ```bash
  diff <(command1) <(command2)
  ```
  Compares the output of two commands using `diff`.

- **Xargs for Batch Processing**: 
  ```bash
  command1 | xargs -n1 command2
  ```
  Uses the output of `command1` as arguments for `command2`, one at a time.

## Debugging and Analysis
- **Pipe Viewer (pv)**: 
  ```bash
  command1 | pv | command2
  ```
  Monitors the progress of data through a pipe between two commands.

## Chains with Conditional Execution
- **AND and OR Lists**:
  ```bash
  command1 && command2 | command3
  command1 || command2 | command3
  ```
  Executes `command2` only if `command1` succeeds/fails, then pipes to `command3`.
