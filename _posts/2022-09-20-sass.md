SASS or SCSS is a CSS preprocessor. It allows you to use variables, functions, and other features that don't exist in plain CSS.

To install SASS, run:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

To compile a .scss file to .css, run:

```bash
sass file.scss file.css
```

If you want to compile a .scss file to .css and watch for changes, run:

```bash
sass --watch file.scss file.css
```

### Essentialy valid CSS is valid SCSS

## Variables

```scss
$color: #000;
```
