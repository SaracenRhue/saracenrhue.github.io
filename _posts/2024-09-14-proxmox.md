## Disable Enterprise Repository and Add the No-Subscription Repository:

1. **Disable the Proxmox Enterprise Repository**  
   Edit the Proxmox enterprise repository configuration file to disable it:

```bash
nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list
```

Comment out the line in this file by adding a `#` at the beginning:

```bash
# deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-enterprise
```

Save and exit the file (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).

2. **Add the No-Subscription Proxmox Repository**  
   Now, add the Proxmox community repository (no subscription) by creating a new file:

```bash
echo "deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-no-subscription.list
```

3. **Update the Package List**  
   After disabling the enterprise repository and adding the no-subscription repository, update your package list:

```bash
apt update
```

4. **Continue with the Tailscale Installation**  
   Now you can proceed with the remaining commands to install Tailscale, as the package list should update without the `401 Unauthorized` error:

## Installing Tailscale

After setting up the non enterprise repo you can run:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Tailscale in LXC Containers

### What is an LXC?

- A lightweight virtualized Linux system
- Unprivileged LXC: root user (uid 0) in container maps to unprivileged host user for security

### Tailscale in LXC

Tailscale needs `/dev/tun` access which unprivileged containers don't usually have. To enable it:

1. Add these lines to `/etc/pve/lxc/[container-id].conf`:

```bash
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file
```

2. Restart the container

3. Install Tailscale in the container

```bash
apt update && apt install -y curl && curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Adding ISO Files for VM creation

By default all ISO files are stored in `/var/lib/vz/template/iso/` so just download them into it with:

```bash
wget -P /var/lib/vz/template/iso/ <URL_TO_ISO>
```

## Managing LXC Templates

The `pveam` command in Proxmox is used for managing appliance images and templates. It stands for "Proxmox VE Appliance Manager." Here are some key uses of the `pveam` command:

###### List available templates

```bash
pveam list
```

###### Update the list of available templates

```bash
pveam update
```

###### Download a template

```bash
pveam download local <template-name>
```

###### Show details about available templates

```bash
pveam available
```

###### Remove a downloaded template

```bash
pveam remove <template-file>
```

###### Search for specific templates

```bash
pveam search <search-term>
```

###### Show information about a specific template

```bash
pveam info <template-name>
```

These functions allow you to manage the LXC templates available on your Proxmox server, making it easier to create and deploy containers.

## Pass through a physical disk to a VM

To pass through a physical disk in Proxmox to a VM, you can follow these detailed steps:

1. **Identify the Disk**:

   - Run `lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL,WWN` in the terminal to list all hard disks along with their model names and serial numbers. Identify the disk you want to pass through by noting its details.

2. **Find the Disk ID**:

   - Use `ls -l /dev/disk/by-id` to locate the disk by its unique ID, which remains constant even if other system changes occur.

   ```bash
   lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL,WWN && ls -l /dev/disk/by-id
   ```

3. **Pass the Disk to the VM**:
   - Execute the following command, replacing `[VM_ID]` with your virtual machine's ID and `[FULL_ID_OF_DISK]` with the full ID of the disk from step 2:
     ```
     qm set [VM_ID] -scsi1 /dev/disk/by-id/[FULL_ID_OF_DISK]
     ```
   - This command adds the disk to the VM. If you're already using a SCSI disk, make sure to use a unique SCSI number (e.g., `-scsi1`, `-scsi2`, etc.).
