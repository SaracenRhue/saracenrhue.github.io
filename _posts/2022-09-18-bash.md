Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a widely used command language interpreter for the GNU operating system. It offers scripting capabilities, allowing for task automation, program execution, and more. Bash is a powerful tool for managing servers, automating tasks, and developing in a Linux environment.

## Basic Bash Commands

### Running Scripts

Execute a script:

```bash
bash script.sh
```

Make a script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x ./script.sh
./script.sh
```

### File System Operations

Change directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Return to the home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Move back one directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

Copy files:

```bash
cp /path/to/file /path/to/destination
```

Move files:

```bash
mv /path/to/file /path/to/destination
```

List files in the current directory:

```bash
ls
```

List all files, including hidden ones:

```bash
ls -a
```

List files in a specific directory:

```bash
ls /path/to/directory
```

Create a new file:

```bash
touch file.txt
```

Create a new directory:

```bash
mkdir directory
```

Delete files:

```bash
rm file.txt
```

Delete a directory and its contents:

```bash
rm -r directory
```

### Writing to Files

Append text to a file:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" >> file.txt
```

Overwrite text in a file:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > file.txt
```

## Bash Variables

Defining variables:

```bash
name="John"
age=30
is_admin=true
```

Accessing variables:

```bash
echo $name
```

### String Manipulation

Convert to uppercase:

```bash
msg="hello"
echo ${msg^^}
```

Convert to lowercase:

```bash
msg="HELLO"
echo ${msg,,}
```

Replace text in a string:

```bash
msg="hello world"
echo ${msg/world/universe}
```

## Arrays

Defining an array:

```bash
my_array=(apple banana cherry)
```

Accessing array elements:

```bash
echo ${my_array[0]} # Outputs 'apple'
```

Adding elements to an array:

```bash
my_array+=(date)
```

## Associative Arrays (Dictionaries)

Defining an associative array:

```bash
declare -A user
user[name]="John"
user[age]=30
```

Accessing associative array elements:

```bash
echo ${user[name]}
```

## Passing Arguments to Scripts

```bash
./script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Inside `script.sh`:

```bash
echo $1 # First argument
echo $2 # Second argument
```

## System Variables

Commonly used system variables:

```bash
echo $USER          # Current username
echo $BASH_VERSION  # Bash version
echo $PWD           # Current directory
echo $HOME          # Home directory
```

## Input and Output

Reading user input:

```bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name"
```

Silent input (e.g., for passwords):

```bash
read -s password
```

## Flow Control

### If Statement

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands
elif [ other_condition ]; then
    # other commands
else
    # else commands
fi
```

### Loops

#### While Loop

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # commands
done
```

#### For Loop

Loop over a range of numbers:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    echo $i
done
```

Loop over a list:

```bash
for i in apple banana cherry; do
    echo $i
done
```

## Functions

Defining a function:

```bash
function greet {
    echo "Hello, $1"
}
```

Calling a function with arguments:

```bash
greet John
```

## Advanced Concepts

### Process Control

Background a process:

```bash
long_running_command &
```

Kill a process:

```bash
kill [process_id]
```

### Text Processing

Using `grep` to search inside files:

```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt
```

Using `awk` for pattern scanning and processing:

```bash
awk '/pattern/ { print $0 }' file.txt
```

Using `sed` for stream editing:

```bash
sed 's/old/new/g' file

.txt
```

### Networking

Download files with `wget`:

```bash
wget [url]
```

Transfer files with `scp`:

```bash
scp file.txt user@remote:/path
```
