HTMX is a modern JavaScript library that allows you to access AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML, making it easier to build dynamic web applications. HTMX is designed to be highly accessible, requiring minimal JavaScript to enhance web pages.

## Getting Started with HTMX

### Installation

Include HTMX in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org"></script>
```

### Basic Usage

HTMX extends HTML by adding custom attributes. The most common attributes are:

- `hx-get`: Load content from a URL via AJAX GET request.
- `hx-post`: Send data to a server via AJAX POST request.
- `hx-put`: Update data on a server via AJAX PUT request.
- `hx-delete`: Send a DELETE request to a server.
- `hx-trigger`: Define when the AJAX request should be triggered.
- `hx-target`: Specifies where to place the returned content.
- `hx-swap`: Controls how the new content is swapped into the DOM.

### Examples

#### Basic GET Request

```html
<a href="/example" hx-get="/example" hx-trigger="click">Load Content</a>
```

#### Form Submission via POST

```html
<form hx-post="/submit-form" hx-target="#result">
  <input type="text" name="message">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<div id="result"></div>
```

#### Lazy Loading

```html
<div hx-get="/load-content" hx-trigger="revealed">
  <!-- Content will be loaded when this div is scrolled into view -->
</div>
```

## Advanced Features

### WebSockets

HTMX can interact with WebSockets:

```html
<div hx-ws="connect:/my-websocket">
  <!-- Content here can be updated via WebSocket messages -->
</div>
```

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

HTMX supports SSE for real-time updates from the server:

```html
<div hx-sse="connect:/my-sse">
  <!-- Content here can be updated in real-time from the server -->
</div>
```

### Boosting Links and Forms

The `hx-boost` attribute enhances standard HTML forms and links with AJAX capabilities:

```html
<!-- Link boosting -->
<a href="/example" hx-boost="true">Load with AJAX</a>

<!-- Form boosting -->
<form action="/submit-form" method="post" hx-boost="true">
  <!-- Form elements -->
</form>
```

## Events

HTMX emits custom events for various stages of the request lifecycle, such as:

- `htmx:beforeRequest`
- `htmx:afterRequest`
- `htmx:beforeSwap`
- `htmx:afterSwap`

Example of handling an HTMX event:

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:afterSwap', function(event) {
  console.log('Content swapped!', event.detail);
});
```

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Use HTMX as an enhancement; ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript.
- **Debugging**: Use browser developer tools to inspect HTMX requests and responses.
- **Performance**: Keep an eye on the number of AJAX requests to avoid performance issues.
