pyenv is a tool to manage multiple versions of Python. It is similar to rbenv, nvm, and other language version managers.
This is especially for macOS since it comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed.

## Installation

Install pyenv with homebrew and add the initializer to your shell profile and reload it.

```bash
brew install pyenv
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage

### check available versions

```bash
pyenv versions
```

### install a version of Python

```bash
pyenv install 3.10.5
```

### set the global version of Python

This will then be your default Python environment.

```bash
pyenv global 3.10.5
```
