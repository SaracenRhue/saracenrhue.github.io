SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight, disk-based database. It doesn't require a separate server process and allows access to the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. SQLite is a popular choice for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers and mobile apps.

Key characteristics of SQLite:
- **Serverless**: SQLite doesn't require a separate server process or system.
- **Zero Configuration**: No setup or administration needed.
- **Cross-Platform**: Accessible on various systems and languages.
- **Self-Contained**: A single ordinary disk file holds the complete database.

SQLite is often used for:
- Local data storage for mobile apps.
- Stand-in for a traditional database during prototyping and development.
- Internal or temporary databases.
- Small to medium-sized websites.

### SQLite with Python

#### Installation

Python's standard library includes SQLite3, which means you don't need to install anything additional to start using SQLite.

#### Basic Usage

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to SQLite Database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a Cursor Object
c = conn.cursor()

# Create Table
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks
             (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')

# Insert a Row of Data
c.execute("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2024-01-23','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)")

# Save (commit) the changes
conn.commit()

# Query Data
for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks ORDER BY price'):
    print(row)

# Close the Connection
conn.close()
```

### SQLite with Node.js

#### Installation

Node.js doesn't include SQLite in its standard library, so you need to install it using npm.

```bash
npm install sqlite3
```

#### Basic Usage

```javascript
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

// Connect to SQLite Database
let db = new sqlite3.Database('./example.db', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
  }
  console.log('Connected to the SQLite database.');
});

// Create Table
db.run('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)');

// Insert a Row of Data
db.run("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2024-01-23','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)");

// Query Data
db.all("SELECT * FROM stocks", [], (err, rows) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  rows.forEach((row) => {
    console.log(row);
  });
});

// Close the Database
db.close((err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err.message);
  }
  console.log('Close the database connection.');
});
```

SQLite is an excellent choice for applications needing the flexibility of a relational database without the overhead of a full-scale database management system. It's widely appreciated for its simplicity, reliability, and ease of integration.
