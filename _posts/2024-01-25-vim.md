## Introduction

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It's an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

### Install Vim using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install vim
```

## Basic Commands

### Opening and Exiting

- **Open Vim:**

  ```bash
  vim #or vi
  ```
  
- **Open a file:**

  ```bash
  vim filename
  ```

- **Exit Vim:**
  - `:q` (if no changes were made)
  - `:q!` (to exit without saving changes)
  - `:wq` (to save changes and exit)
  - `ZZ` (to save and quit)

### Navigation

- **Move cursor:**
  - `h` (left), `j` (down), `k` (up), `l` (right)
- **Go to start of the file:**
  - `gg`
- **Go to end of the file:**
  - `G`
- **Go to line number (e.g., line 5):**
  - `:5`

### Editing

- **Insert mode:**
  - `i` (before cursor), `I` (start of line), `a` (after cursor), `A` (end of line)

### Search and Replace

### Visual Mode
