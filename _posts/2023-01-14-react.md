## Install

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then run the following command to make shure the latest version of `create-react-app` is installed globally.

```bash
npm uninstall -g create-react-app
npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Usage

Create a new app with the name `my-app` and run it on `localhost:3000`.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Components

Everything in React is a component. Components are the building blocks of React apps. A component is a JavaScript function that returns HTML elements to be rendered to the page. Components can be written as a function or a class.<br>
By default, React components are written as JavaScript functions and everything is in the `App.js` file. The `App.js` file is the root component of the application. It is the first component that is rendered when the application starts.<br>
It is usefull to put all components in .jsx: files and in a folder called `components`. This makes it easier to find the components and to reuse them in other projects.<br>
It makes sense to write components as const functions and functions as normal functions. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.

```javascript
export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <div className='main'>
        {movies.map(createCard)}
      </div>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

* use `{ }` to write js expressions in components
* use `className` instead of `class` to set the class of an element (use camelCase instead of kebab-case as in html)
* use `export default` to export a component

```javascript
export const Card = (props) => {
  return (
    <a href='#home'>
      <img className='card' src={props.src} alt='#' />
    </a>
  );
};

function createCard(movie) {
  return <Card key={movie.id} src={movie.posterurl} />;
}

export { createCard };
```

If you want to map a component every time you need to use the `key` attribute. The `key` attribute is used to identify each element in the list. It is used by React to keep track of the list items and to update the list efficiently. The `key` attribute is not accessible in the component. Every element in the list needs to have a unique `key` attribute.
