## Introduction to SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely connect to a remote server or computer over an unsecured network. SSH provides secure channel over an unsecured network by using a client-server architecture, encrypting the data transmitted.

## Basic SSH Commands

### Connect to a Server
To connect to a server using SSH:
```bash
ssh username@server_ip
```

### Connect to a Server on a Specific Port
If the server is listening on a non-default port (default is 22):
```bash
ssh -p port_number username@server_ip
```

### Execute a Command on a Server
To run a command (e.g., `ls`) on the server without entering into interactive mode:
```bash
ssh username@server_ip "command"
```

### Copy a File to a Server (SCP)
To securely copy a file from your local machine to a remote server:
```bash
scp local_file.txt username@server_ip:/remote/directory/
```

### Copy a File from a Server (SCP)
To copy a file from the remote server to your local machine:
```bash
scp username@server_ip:/remote/file.txt /local/directory
```

## SSH Keys

### Generating SSH Keys
Generate a new SSH key pair (public and private) using:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
This command generates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label. `-t` specifies the type of key to create (here RSA), and `-b` specifies the number of bits in the key (more bits means more secure).

### Copying Public Key to Server
After generating your SSH keys, copy your public key to the remote server for password-less login:
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub username@server_ip
```
Replace `mykey.pub` with your public key file if you're not using the default name or path.

### Permissions for SSH Keys
Ensure correct permissions for your SSH keys:
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
This sets the directory permissions to `700`, private key to `600`, and public key to `644`.

## Advanced SSH Usage

### SSH Config File
You can create an SSH config file for easier management of multiple SSH connections:

1. Create a config file in your SSH directory:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.ssh/config
   ```
2. Edit the file to add your SSH hosts. For example:
   ```bash
   Host myserver
       HostName server_ip
       User username
       Port port_number
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykey
   ```

### SSH Tunneling (Port Forwarding)
SSH tunneling allows you to forward a port on your local machine to a port on the remote server:

1. Local Port Forwarding:
   ```bash
   ssh -L local_port:localhost:remote_port username@server_ip
   ```
   This forwards a local port to a remote port via the SSH server.

2. Remote Port Forwarding:
   ```bash
   ssh -R remote_port:localhost:local_port username@server_ip
   ```
   This forwards a remote port to a local port via the SSH server.

### SSH Agent Forwarding
SSH agent forwarding allows you to use your local SSH keys on a remote server:

1. Start the SSH agent in the background:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```
2. Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
3. Connect with agent forwarding enabled:
   ```bash
   ssh -A username@server_ip
   ```

### Using SSH with Git
For Git operations over SSH, configure Git to use SSH keys:

1. Set your Git SSH command:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.sshCommand 'ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes'
   ```
2. Clone a repository using SSH:
   ```bash
   git clone ssh://git@server_ip:port/repository.git
   ```
