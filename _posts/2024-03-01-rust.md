```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Cargo Package Manager

Cargo is the Rust package manager. It is used to compile, test, and run Rust projects. Cargo is also used to manage dependencies.

### Installation

Cargo is included with the Rust installation. To check if Cargo is installed, run:

```bash
cargo --version
```

### Create a New Project

To create a new Rust project, run:

```bash
cargo new hello_world
```

This will create a new directory called `hello_world` with the following structure:

```plaintext
hello_world
├── Cargo.toml
├── src
│   └── main.rs
```

### Add Package Dependencies

To add a package dependency, open the `Cargo.toml` file in the project directory and add the following line:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.4"
``` 

This will add the `rand` package as a dependency to the project.

### Build and Run

To build and run the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Variables

Rust variables are immutable by default. To make a variable mutable, add the `mut` keyword before the variable name.

```rust
let mut x = 5;
```

## Data Types

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is known at compile time. However, the compiler can usually infer the data type based on the value and how it is used.

### Scalar Types

| Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `i8` | 1 byte | Signed 8-bit integer |
| `i16` | 2 bytes | Signed 16-bit integer |
| `i32` | 4 bytes | Signed 32-bit integer |
| `i64` | 8 bytes | Signed 64-bit integer |
| `u8` | 1 byte | Unsigned 8-bit integer |
| `u16` | 2 bytes | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
| `u32` | 4 bytes | Unsigned 32-bit integer |
| `u64` | 8 bytes | Unsigned 64-bit integer |
| `isize` | size of pointer | Signed integer of the size of a pointer |
| `usize` | size of pointer | Unsigned integer of the size of a pointer |
| `f32` | 4 bytes | 32-bit floating point number |
| `f64` | 8 bytes | 64-bit floating point number |
| `char` | 4 bytes | Unicode scalar value |
| `bool` | 1 byte | Boolean value |

### Arrays

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

```rust
a[0] = 6;
a.push(7);
a.pop();
a.remove(2);
```

## Hash Maps (Dictionaries)

```rust
let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert("Blue", 10);
scores.remove("Blue");
```

## IO

### Read Input

To read input from the user, use the `std::io` module.

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    println!("You entered: {input}");
}
```

### Print Output

To print output to the console, use the `println!` macro.
    
```rust
println!("Hello, World!");  
```

## Control Flow

### if else Statement

```rust
if number % 2 == 0 {
    println!("The number is even");
} else {
    println!("The number is odd");
}
```

### match Statement

```rust
match number {
    1 => println!("One"),
    2 => println!("Two"),
    3 => println!("Three"),
    _ => println!("Other"),
}
```

### while Statement

```rust
let mut number = 3;
while number != 0 {
    println!("{number}");
    number -= 1;
}
```

### loop Statement

```rust
loop {
    println!("Loop forever!");
}
```

## Functions

```rust
fn another_function(x: bool) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

### Return Values

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5 //as i32 (optional casting)
}
```

### Expressions

```rust
let y = {
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
};
println!("The value of y is: {y}");
```
