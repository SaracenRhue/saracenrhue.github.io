icecream is a Python library that makes it easier to debug your code by printing variables and expressions to stdout. It's a drop-in replacement for print() that adds a lot of useful features.

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install icecream
```

## Usage

```python
import icecream as ice
from icecream import ic

test = "hello world"
ic(test)
```

output:

```bash
ic| test: 'hello world'
```

## Documentation

You don't need to import icecream in every file. Instead you can add this to your main.py:

```python
ice.install()
```

You can disable or enable icecream with:

```python
ic.disable()
```

```python
ic.enable()
```
